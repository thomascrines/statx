[![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip) [![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/thomascrines/statxplorer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/thomascrines/statxplorer) 

# statxplorer

Use statxplorer to download data from [Stat-Xplore](https://stat-xplore.dwp.gov.uk/webapi/jsf/login.xhtml). statxplorer can be used interactively, or as part of a [reproducible analytical pipeline](https://ukgovdatascience.github.io/rap_companion/).

## Installation

Install opendatascot from GitHub with:


```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("thomascrines/statxplorer")
```

If the above does not work, you can install from source:

1. Go to the statxplorer [repository](https://github.com/thomascrines/statxplorer) on GitHub
1. Click **Clone or download** then **Download ZIP**
1. Save the file locally (e.g. your H drive) and Unzip
1. Install with install.packages()


```r
install.packages("your/directory/statxplorer", repos = NULL,
                 type="source", lib = "your/R/package/library/directory")
```

API Keys
-----

Stat-Xplore API requires an API key which can be obtained through their [website](https://stat-xplore.dwp.gov.uk/webapi/online-help/Open-Data-API.html).

Once you have an API key, you can add it to the .Renviron file using the following steps.

* Find your home directory. On Windows run

```r
Sys.getenv('R_USER')
```
And on Mac run

```r
Sys.getenv('HOME')
```
* If there is not already a .Renviron file, create a plain text file in your home directory named .Renviron.
* Add the following to your .Renviron file: 

StatXploreApiKey = "YOUR_KEY"

*.Renviron only applies to RStudio. If you are not using RStudio, use 'Modify environment variables' or update .bash_profile in Mac to set environment variables.

You will also need to update the statx_request_bodies file from 

```r
accessKey <- Sys.getenv("StatXploreApiKey")
```
to refer to your variables.*
