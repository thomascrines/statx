[![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip) [![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/thomascrines/statxplorer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/thomascrines/statxplorer)

statxplorer
===========

Use statxplorer to download data from [Stat-Xplore](https://stat-xplore.dwp.gov.uk/webapi/jsf/login.xhtml). statxplorer can be used interactively, or as part of a [reproducible analytical pipeline](https://ukgovdatascience.github.io/rap_companion/).

Installation
------------

Install opendatascot from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("thomascrines/statxplorer")
```

If the above does not work, you can install from source:

1.  Go to the statxplorer [repository](https://github.com/thomascrines/statxplorer) on GitHub
2.  Click **Clone or download** then **Download ZIP**
3.  Save the file locally (e.g. your H drive) and Unzip
4.  Install with install.packages()

``` r
install.packages("your/directory/statxplorer", repos = NULL,
                 type="source", lib = "your/R/package/library/directory")
```

API Keys
--------

Stat-Xplore API requires an API key which can be obtained through their [website](https://stat-xplore.dwp.gov.uk/webapi/online-help/Open-Data-API.html).

Once you have an API key, you can add it to the .Renviron file using the following steps.

-   Find your home directory. On Windows run

``` r
Sys.getenv('R_USER')
```

And on Mac run

``` r
Sys.getenv('HOME')
```

-   If there is not already a .Renviron file, create a plain text file in your home directory named .Renviron.
-   Add the following to your .Renviron file:

StatXploreApiKey = "YOUR\_KEY"

.Renviron only applies to RStudio. If you are not using RStudio, use 'Modify environment variables' or update .bash\_profile in Mac to set environment variables.

You will also need to update the statx\_request\_bodies file from

``` r
accessKey <- Sys.getenv("StatXploreApiKey")
```

to refer to your variables.

Example
-------

### statx\_add\_request

statxplorer requires a JSON request body to send in a POST request to the Stat-Xplore API. To create one, either write one by hand by the Stat-Xplore guidelines, or use the webite to build a table and save it as Open Data API (.json). Once you have a .json file containing a request, run statx\_add\_request to add it to statexplorer, passing in your desired name for the file and the path of your existing file. For example, if you have a file with the path 'C:\\Downloads\\PensionCreditsNew001.json', that you want to save as 'PensionCredits', run `statx_add_request('PensionCredits', 'C:\\Downloads\\PensionCreditsNew001.json')`.

### statx\_requests

To see a full list of the names of all available JSON requests, run `statx_requests()`.

### statx\_print\_request

To print the contents of a .json request file to the console pass the name of the request to statx\_print\_request. For example, `statx_print_request('PensionCredits')`.

### statx\_dataset

To return a complete dataset from Stat-Xplore based on an existing JSON request, pass the name of the request to statx\_dataset. For example, `statx_dataset('PensionCredits')`.
